# AntiEnergySavingVolumeControl

My Creative T6300 speakers automatically shut themselves if for more than 15 minutes the volume output from the PC is less than 25%. 
This is obviously a problem.

What this program does is REPLACE the windows 8/10 volume controler. The one that is called when you press volume up/volume down on your keyboard (if you have such buttons.)

This new volume controler will control the sound from 25% to 100%. But 25% will be the new 0% and 100% will remain the 0%.

This accomplishes that YOU CAN NEVER GO BELOW THE 25% threshold and your speakers WILL NOT turn off by themselves anymore.

In this new volume controler if you go to 0% the sound is muted just as if it was a real 0%.

Obviously you will need to adjust the physical volume controler on your speakers to the appropriate level so that you are comfortable with the new 25% to 100% interval.

## THIS PROJECT IS JUST STARTED, NO DEVELOPMENT YET DONE.... 
Everything great starts with an idea, working stuff coming soon
